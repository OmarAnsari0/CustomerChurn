# `Problem Statement: Customer Churn Prediction`

In today's competitive business landscape, customer retention is paramount for sustainable growth and success. Our challenge is to develop a predictive model that can identify customers who are at risk of churning â€“ discontinuing their use of our service. Customer churn can lead to a significant loss of revenue and a decline in market share. By leveraging machine learning techniques, I aim to build a model that can accurately predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on their historical usage behavior, demographic information, and subscription details. This predictive model will allow us to proactively target high-risk customers with personalized retention strategies, ultimately helping us enhance customer satisfaction, reduce churn rates, and optimize our business strategies. The goal is to create an effective solution that contributes to the long-term success of our company by fostering customer loyalty and engagement.

# `Data Description`
Dataset consists customer information for a customer churn prediction problem. It includes the following columns:

* **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
  

* **Gender**: Gender of the customer (Male or Female).


* **Location**: Location where the customer is based, with options including West midlands, Surrey, Greater London etc.
  

* **Partner**: Whether the user lives alone or with a partner.


* **Dependents**: Whether the user live alone or with a dependent.


* **Seinor**: Whether the user is a senior citizen.
  

* **Tenure**: Length of tenure


* **Monthly_cost**: Monthly bill amount for the customer.

* **Package** : What type of package does the user have

* **Survey** : Survey points from each user.

* **Class**: A binary indicator (1 or 0) representing whether the customer has churned (1) or not (0).

# `Teck Tech Used`
* **Python Programming Language**

Python serves as the primary programming language for data analysis, modeling, and implementation of machine learning algorithms due to its rich ecosystem of libraries and packages.

* **Pandas**

Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures and functions for effectively working with structured data, such as CSV files or databases.

* **NumPy**

NumPy is a fundamental package for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a wide range of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

* **Matplotlib and Seaborn**

Matplotlib is used for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python. Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and provides a high-level interface for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics.

* **Jupyter Notebook**

Jupyter Notebook is an interactive web-based tool that allows for creating and sharing documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It is commonly used for data analysis and exploration.

* **Scikit-Learn (sklearn)**

Scikit-Learn is a machine learning library in Python that provides a wide range of tools for various machine learning tasks such as classification, regression, clustering, model selection, and more.

* **Random Forest Classifier**

Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to create a more robust and accurate model. It's used for both classification and regression tasks.


* **Support Vector Machine(SVM)**

The VIF is used to detect multicollinearity among predictor variables in a regression analysis. It helps identify redundant variables that might negatively impact model performance.


* **Model Evaluation Metrics**

Various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, ROC curve, and AUC (Area Under Curve) are used to assess the performance of the machine learning models.


* **Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

These are different classification algorithms used to build predictive models based on the given data. Each algorithm has its own strengths and weaknesses.


* **StandardScaler**

StandardScaler is used for standardizing features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. It's an important preprocessing step in machine learning to ensure features are on similar scales.


* **OneHot Encoding**

One-hot encoding is a technique for converting categorical variables into a binary matrix. Each category is represented by a unique binary vector with a single "1" and the rest as "0"s, ensuring that the data is suitable for machine learning algorithms.



* **Standard Machine Learning Libraries**

The project utilizes standard machine learning libraries like SciPy and scikit-learn for various tasks including preprocessing, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.


# `Outcome`
The outcome of this customer churn prediction project involves developing a machine learning model to predict whether customers are likely to churn or not. This prediction is based on various customer attributes such as gender, location, subscription length, monthly bill, senior citizen, dependents and survey. The model's primary purpose is to assist in identifying customers who are at a higher risk of churning, enabling the business to take proactive measures to retain them. By using the trained model to predict churn, the company can allocate resources more effectively, personalize engagement strategies, and implement targeted retention efforts. Ultimately, the project's success is measured by the model's ability to make predictions, helping the company reduce churn rates, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize its customer retention strategies.
